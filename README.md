# My Portfolio Website

My portfolio website was made to showcase my abilities, and projects I worked on so far. It was made with ReactJS and for the styling I used TailwindCSS for the first time, I fell in love with it. :)

I added a small feature to it, with a button you can toggle light and darkmode with default dark mode. So the user can decide which they prefer.

The deployment happened with Netlify and gave me quiet a headache at the beginning, but eventually I managed to build it for production. The challenging part was my tailwind.config along with my package.json files, but after setting the correct purge and scripts, it worked finally.

## Coming soon

Proper validation, updating React Router to v6, changing the contact form from Netlify to emailJS, and some styling adjustment.
